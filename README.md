# Irregular Shift Importer
An application to insert an irregular, custom pattern based shift into Google Calendar

The pattern is defined by the scheduler at my girlfriend's work. It is as follows:

 * A8 states a shift starting 07:00, lasting 8 hours
 * D9 states a shift from 10:00 to 19:00
 * Hb72 is a shift from 14:30 to 22:00
 * Hbs0 is the night shift, from 14:30 to 7:30 the next morning
